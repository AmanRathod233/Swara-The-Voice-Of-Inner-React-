                            Overthinking or rumination is a cognitive process where people are stuck in a repetitive and unproductive cycle of negative thinking. While repetitive thinking about yourself and situations is common. But overthinking is an excessive emphasize on hypothetical situations, potential problems, past events, or mentally replaying conversations repetitively. Often, you find yourself unable to stop thinking about unpleasant thoughts or concentrate on anything. This can have a significant impact on your mental & physical health, as well as relationships, jobs and decision making.                              </p>

                               <li>Rumination: In this, people repeatedly think about past problems, mistakes, events, situations and get trapped in past memories. This involves ruminating own and others' mistakes in detail, which can create a loop of negative thoughts.  </li>
                               <li>Worry: This is the opposite of rumination and focuses on future events revolving around hypothetical situations.  </li>
                               <li>All-or-Nothing Thinking: These people often think of extremes of any situation, like how a trip can make them truly happy or it can be a flop. </li>
                               <li>Overgeneralization: This is when one creates a perception based on past experience. People assume something will always be the same based on one instance.</li>
                               <li>Perfectionist: This involves setting the bar too high and being too critical of oneself.</li>

                            There are many reasons why people overthink, while some might be aware of it, others might be doing it unconsciously. Every person is different, and so are the reasons for overthinking. The following are the common reasons for overthinking:

                                <li>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</li>
                                <p className="singleblog_box_information">People suffering from GAD often experience excessive thoughts of every aspect of life, from personal relations to career and finances. It is important to note that these episodes are not occasional and can last from weeks to months. People with GAD can take even the smallest situations as a potential threat, which leads to the worst-case scenarios.  </p>
                                <li>Fear of Failure </li>
                                <p className="singleblog_box_information">People Fear is one of the most common reasons for overthinking. People with a strong sense of failure tend to overanalyze decisions and situations to avoid any mistakes. They ruminate on their thoughts and think of the worst-case scenarios. This often leads to the vicious cycle of negative thoughts and replaying different scenarios in the mind.</p>
                                <li> Trauma & Past Experiences</li>
                                <p className="singleblog_box_information">Often, people who have experienced traumatic situations in the past overthink as a protective mechanism. This involves overthinking every situation to prevent any distress. Trauma survivors often get stuck in a constant hyper-vigilant state, which keeps them in high alert of potential threats.</p>
                                
                                <li>Low-Self Esteem  </li>
                                <p className="singleblog_box_information">People with low self esteem often are doubtful of their capabilities and decisions, which can lead to overthinking.  They are always think they are not good enough and are fear of what others think of them. They also don't trust their own decisions, which can lead them to analyze every action to find reassurance from others. </p>
                                
                                <li>Constant Comparison & Pressure  </li>
                                <p className="singleblog_box_information">Often people find themselves comparing themself to others, including family members, friends, peers or constant social pressure that can lead to overthinking. With the rise of social media usage, people often feel insecure and unhappy looking at ‘happier or successful’ people without actually knowing the reality</p>
                                
                                <li>Perfectisim</li>
                                <p className="singleblog_box_information">Sometimes people who are perfectionists often set the standards too high for themself, which makes them obsessed with ‘getting it done my way’. They over-scrutinize every decision and every detail of their actions to do everything ‘flawlessly’. These types of people also want to fix the smallest flaws or mistakes, and fear being criticized or judged. This can lead to low self-esteem, burnout or chronic stress.</p>
